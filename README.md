## Updating your local environment

The `environment.yml` in this repository
contains all of the necessary packages. To update your local environment:

**Step 1.** Download the `environment.yml` file in this repository to your computer.

**Important:** Make sure you download the **raw** version of the file from GitHub and that the file extension on your computer is `.yml`.

**Step 2.** From either the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal app (MacOS):

```
conda env update --file environment.yml --name musa-620
```

where `musa-620` should be the same name of the environment you have been using.
